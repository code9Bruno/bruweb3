<h1>JUNGLE WALK</h1>

<p>(Verse 1)<br>
In the heart of the jungle, the sun's shining bright,
Monkeys swingin' high, what a glorious sight,
Parrots are squawkin', colors flash in the air,
Lions roar with laughter, spreading joy everywhere.Elephants stomp in rhythm, their feet shake the ground,
Giraffes dance tall, twirling round and round,
Tigers bring the rhythm, with a beat that's so sweet,
All the animals gather, moving to the heat.</p>

<h3 class="eleph">ELEPHANTS</h3>
<p>(Verse 3)<br>
Underneath the stars, the night comes alive,
Fireflies are twinkling, as the jungle vibes thrive,
With every paw and claw, they celebrate the night,
Together in the wild, everything feels just right.
Giraffes dance tall, twirling round and round,
Tigers bring the rhythm, with a beat that's so sweet,
All the animals gather, moving to the heat.

<p>(Verse 2)<br>
Elephants stomp in rhythm, their feet shake the ground,
Giraffes dance tall, twirling round and round,
Tigers bring the rhythm, with a beat that's so sweet,
All the animals gather, moving to the heat.
In the heart of the jungle, the sun's shining bright,
Monkeys swingin' high, what a glorious sight,
Parrots are squawkin', colors flash in the air,
Lions roar with laughter, spreading joy everywhere.</p>
